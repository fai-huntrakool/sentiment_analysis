review,label
it s hard to fairly judge a film like ringu when you ve seen the remake first many of the effective horror elements are dampened through familiarity yet are worthwhile ,1
shyamalan takes a potentially trite and overused concept aliens come to earth and infuses it into a rustic realistic and altogether creepy tale of hidden invasion ,1
a fast paced glitzy but extremely silly piece ,0
perhaps the grossest movie ever made funny though ,1
at times it actually hurts to watch ,0
the bottom line with nemesis is the same as it has been with all the films in the series fans will undoubtedly enjoy it and the uncommitted needn t waste their time on it ,0
the movie is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the webcast ,0
first time writer director dylan kidd also has a good ear for dialogue and the characters sound like real people ,0
franco is an excellent choice for the walled off but combustible hustler but he does not give the transcendent performance sonny needs to overcome gaps in character development and story logic ,1
with few respites marshall keeps the energy humming and his edits unlike those in moulin rouge are crisp and purposeful without overdoing it ,1
it s like every bad idea that s ever gone into an after school special compiled in one place minus those daytime programs slickness and sophistication and who knew they even had any ,0
what s at stake in this film is nothing more than an obsolete if irritating notion of class ,0
nicks seemingly uncertain what s going to make people laugh runs the gamut from stale parody to raunchy sex gags to formula romantic comedy ,0
much as we might be interested in gratuitous sexualization haneke has a different objective in mind namely the implications of our craving for fake stimulation ,1
like an episode of mtv s undressed with 20 times the creativity but without any more substance indulgently entertaining but could have and should have been deeper ,1
just a collection of this and that whatever fills time with no unified whole ,0
though ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way there s nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention ,0
despite a blue chip cast and a provocative title writer director peter mattei s first feature microwaves dull leftover romantic motifs basted in faux contemporary gravy ,0
 with one exception every blighter in this particular south london housing project digs into dysfunction like it s a big comforting jar of marmite to be slathered on crackers and served as a feast of bleakness ,1
an inuit masterpiece that will give you goosebumps as its uncanny tale of love communal discord and justice unfolds ,1
goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures and it looks as though jay roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab ,0
a fanciful drama about napoleon s last years and his surprising discovery of love and humility ,1
it deserves to be seen by anyone with even a passing interest in the events shaping the world beyond their own horizons ,1
the high concept scenario soon proves preposterous the acting is robotically italicized and truth in advertising hounds take note there s very little hustling on view ,0
the movie is as padded as allen s jelly belly ,0
a first class thoroughly involving b movie that effectively combines two surefire beloved genres the prison flick and the fight film ,1
if ayurveda can help us return to a sane regimen of eating sleeping and stress reducing contemplation it is clearly a good thing ,1
the sequel is everything the original was not contrived overblown and tie in ready ,0
rain is a small treasure enveloping the viewer in a literal and spiritual torpor that is anything but cathartic ,1
the overall effect is awe and affection and a strange urge to get on a board and uh shred dude ,1
see it now before the inevitable hollywood remake flattens out all its odd intriguing wrinkles ,1
the film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water bound action over the land based drama but the emphasis on the latter leaves blue crush waterlogged ,0
cattaneo reworks the formula that made the full monty a smashing success but neglects to add the magic that made it all work ,0
its inescapable absurdities are tantamount to insulting the intelligence of anyone who hasn t been living under a rock since sept 11 ,0
 if you are in the mood for an intelligent weepy it can easily worm its way into your heart ,1
reggio falls victim to relying on the very digital technology that he fervently scorns creating a meandering inarticulate and ultimately disappointing film ,0
no way i can believe this load of junk ,0
lillard and cardellini earn their scooby snacks but not anyone else ,0
the movie isn t painfully bad something to be fully experienced it s just tediously bad something to be fully forgotten ,0
the santa clause 2 proves itself a more streamlined and thought out encounter than the original could ever have hoped to be ,1
as comedic spotlights go notorious c h o hits all the verbal marks it should ,1
at once subtle and visceral the film never succumbs to the trap of the maudlin or tearful offering instead with its unflinching gaze a measure of faith in the future ,1
the film s heady yet far from impenetrable theory suggests that russians take comfort in their closed off nationalist reality ,1
it s better than the phantom menace but unless you re an absolute raving star wars junkie it isn t much fun ,0
peralta captures in luminous interviews and amazingly evocative film from three decades ago the essence of the dogtown experience ,1
the large format film is well suited to capture these musicians in full regalia and the incredible imax sound system lets you feel the beat down to your toes ,1
a reworking of die hard and cliffhanger but it s nowhere near as exciting as either ,0
read my lips is to be viewed and treasured for its extraordinary intelligence and originality as well as its lyrical variations on the game of love ,1
campanella s competent direction and his excellent cast overcome the obstacles of a predictable outcome and a screenplay that glosses over rafael s evolution ,1
i prefer soderbergh s concentration on his two lovers over tarkovsky s mostly male mostly patriarchal debating societies ,1
if villainous vampires are your cup of blood blade 2 is definitely a cut above the rest ,1
feels like a cold old man going through the motions ,0
even in terms of the low grade cheese standards on which it operates it never quite makes the grade as tawdry trash ,0
a smart arch and rather cold blooded comedy ,1
everything that has to do with yvan and charlotte and everything that has to do with yvan s rambunctious jewish sister and her non jew husband feels funny and true ,1
adam sandler s heart may be in the right place but he needs to pull his head out of his butt,0
thoughtful provocative and entertaining ,1
lan yu is a genuine love story full of traditional layers of awakening and ripening and separation and recovery ,1
one key problem with these ardently christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out ,0
the simplicity of the way home has few equals this side of aesop,1

a dream cast of solid female talent who build a seamless ensemble there isn t a weak or careless performance amongst them ,1
storytelling feels slight ,0
whether it s the worst movie of 2002 i can t say for sure memories of rollerball have faded and i skipped country bears but this new jangle of noise mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title ,0
